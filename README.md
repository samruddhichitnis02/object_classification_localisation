I have created a single model for Classification and Localisation 
The dataset can be downloaded from  <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/images.tar.gz">here</a> and the ground truth can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/annotations.tar.gz">here</a>
Model is able to calssify and localise cats and dogs with good accuracy
I have solved this problem using pytorch and the pretrained model I have used is resnet34
